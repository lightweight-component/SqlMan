# The XML Template Engine
I need to template to do the jobs like MyBatis `<if><else><foreach>`. However, it's not easy to achieve it.
MyBatis is using own XML parser with OGNL expression engine, details [here](https://www.cnblogs.com/fangjian0423/p/mybaits-dynamic-sql-analysis.html).

It's hard to copy that.

Another way is to use the common template engine, like Thymeleaf/Freemarker, but it's too heavy I think.

[Beetl](http://ibeetl.com/) is a sharp project, better than Java HTML template engines, and it mentions the library ANTLR like a compiler.

It's a advanced topic, I don't think I can handle it well.

However, I'm considering to put this problem on other hand, This is a question about how to implement your own DSL.


At this point, [dropincc.java](https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java), a small parser generator, comes into my eyes, and the author says,
 it ships with a [template engine](http://pfmiles.github.io/blog/what-does-a-template-engine-for-code-generation-look-like/) 
that can be used to generatetemplate engine, which is exactly what I need. But I can't find its implementation in the project!

So, The ANTLR's [StringTemplate](https://www.jianshu.com/p/d87ef30a2f63) is the best choice. StringTemplate seems to be the only choice.
