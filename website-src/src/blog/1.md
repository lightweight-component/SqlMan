I can't remember how many iterations this project has gone through. It's been at least eight
                            years since I first attempted to encapsulate JDBC API, and throughout this time, I've been
                            obsessed with achieving a better implementation to improve development efficiency.
                            Gradually, I've developed an overall approach and have implemented it in code, but something
                            always feels off; the components just don't seem to be as user-friendly as they should be.
                            This led me to realize that the issue lies with the API style. Having pinpointed the
                            problem, I plan to refactor once again, aiming to make it more usable, clearer, and more
                            intuitive. Honestly, designing the right style requires inspiration...

                            <!-- 我已经不记得是第几次迭代这个项目了，过去那么多年（起码八年以上），从我第一次尝试封装 JDBC 开始，
                            我一直执迷于更好的实现，以便提高开发效率。整体思路渐渐是有了，也编码好了，但总感觉哪里别扭，组件都觉得不好用。
                            于是发现就是 API 风格问题。既然到位了问题 那么就再重构一次，目标是使其更易用、更清晰、更一目了然。老实说，风格的设计需要灵感…… -->
