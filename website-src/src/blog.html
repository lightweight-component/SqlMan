                        <p>Looking at backend development as a whole, most of the work revolves around database
                            development (commonly
                            referred to as "CRUD Boy"). How we interact with databases is closely related to our
                            development experience.
                            The industry frequently discusses the "object-relational impedance mismatch," which lies at
                            the heart of the
                            issue: given that we have two different "programming worldviews"—a relational model database
                            (SQL) and a
                            programming language (Java, C#, Go)—each with its own methodologies, use cases, and ways of
                            thinking, how
                            can they coexist harmoniously and exchange information? Clearly, the "impedance mismatch" is
                            not an easy
                            problem to solve.</p>

                            I can't remember how many iterations this project has gone through. It's been at least eight
                            years since I first attempted to encapsulate JDBC API, and throughout this time, I've been
                            obsessed with achieving a better implementation to improve development efficiency.
                            Gradually, I've developed an overall approach and have implemented it in code, but something
                            always feels off; the components just don't seem to be as user-friendly as they should be.
                            This led me to realize that the issue lies with the API style. Having pinpointed the
                            problem, I plan to refactor once again, aiming to make it more usable, clearer, and more
                            intuitive. Honestly, designing the right style requires inspiration...
                            <!-- 
                            我已经不记得是第几次迭代这个项目了，过去那么多年（起码八年以上），从我第一次尝试封装 JDBC 开始，
                            我一直执迷于更好的实现，以便提高开发效率。整体思路渐渐是有了，也编码好了，但总感觉哪里别扭，组件都觉得不好用。
                            于是发现就是 API 风格问题。既然到位了问题 那么就再重构一次，目标是使其更易用、更清晰、更一目了然。老实说，风格的设计需要灵感…… -->
